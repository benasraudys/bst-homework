# BST Merge and Intersection Homework

This repository offers solutions for merging and intersecting two Binary Search Trees (BST) storing Books. Tasks include merging two BSTs into one height-balanced BST and intersecting two BSTs to create another balanced BST. Implementation involves in-order traversal of initial BSTs, storing values in sorted lists, merging/intersecting lists, and constructing balanced BSTs.
